You will need a new or existing [Contentful space][] to use this starter and will be asked for your [Space ID][], [Content Management API Key][] (also referred to as a Personal Access Token) and [Content Delivery API Key][] during installation.

**Note:** Contentful recently adjusted their limitations for free spaces and it is affecting this starter. Free spaces are only allowed to have 25 content types, and this starter currently utilizes 27. We'll be adjusting the associated content in the starter in the next week to work within these new limitations so you all can still experiment with the Contentful and Gatsby stack. Thank you for you understanding.
